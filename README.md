For now this is essentially snippets of code that I am experimenting with to learn Bevy and Rust.

## What is actually in here
Right now I have `main.rs` as the main entry point to run any of the code I am experimenting with. **any** other file in this repo is a junk drawer basically.

## Setup
Get your environment setup with Cargo. `cargo run` will be a nice dice roll to see if anything is actually working in main.
